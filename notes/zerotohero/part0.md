## 🗺️ ** From Hello World to Enterprise-Ready Engineer**

## **Introduction**

Embarking on a software engineering journey can feel overwhelming—so many technologies, frameworks, and best practices to learn. This **10-part mentorship roadmap** is designed to guide Rutuja and Sanika from their very first “Hello World” to becoming **enterprise-ready engineers**. Each part builds systematically on the previous, blending theory with hands-on practice, ensuring that concepts are not just learned, but applied in real-world scenarios. From core Java fundamentals to full-stack integration, CI/CD pipelines, and advanced microservices, this roadmap encapsulates a structured, mentor-guided learning journey.

## **Objective**

* To provide a **clear, step-by-step learning path** from beginner to industry-ready software engineer.
* To reinforce **conceptual understanding** through hands-on projects and exercises.
* To introduce **modern software development practices**, including build automation, testing frameworks, CI/CD, and microservices.
* To simulate **real-world enterprise workflows**, preparing students for challenges in professional environments.
* To create a **visual, easy-to-follow roadmap** that serves as both a learning guide and motivational framework for continuous growth.
