## 👩‍🏫 **Select Last Dual Option — From Hello World to Maven World**

It was another lively evening of mentoring.
The screen flickered with two tiny rectangles — **Rutuja** and **Sanika** —
faces curious, eyes slightly tired but determined.
The previous session had ended with *“Hello World”* compiling successfully.
Today, they were about to take their first step into **project structure, packaging, and Maven.**


### 🧩 Scene 1: “Select last dual option…”

> **Sanika:** “Select last dual option.”
> **Rutuja:** “Back for Java?”
> **Sanika:** “Yes, first install… then code run karaycha.”

It always begins like this — the little confusions, the half-English half-Marathi flow of energy.
They weren’t reading instructions — they were *feeling* their way through setup.
Each “Yes,” “OK,” and “Mhm” was progress.
That’s the language of learning-by-doing.


### 💻 Scene 2: “Open with Code”

They created their **first Java workspace** — manually, like real developers.

> **Sanika:** “Right click → Show more options → Open with Code.”
> **Rutuja:** “Oh, OK… hello world dot Java.”

The moment VS Code opened and the first file appeared in the sidebar — that was magic.
It wasn’t a tutorial anymore; it was *their own playground.*


### 🧠 Scene 3: The “javac” Command Awakens

> **Sanika:** “Control + Shift + C — run the command.”
> **Rutuja:** “Java is not recognized as an internal or external command!”

That error — the one every Java beginner meets — sparked the best learning moment.
Together, they backtracked, checked the **PATH variable**, verified the **JDK installation**,
and when `java --version` finally responded, both grinned.
That’s the *real* debugging spirit — no copy-paste solutions, just problem-solving instinct forming live.


### ⚙️ Scene 4: “Now, let’s add Maven”

> **Sanika:** “Chromevarti search — Maven download for Windows.”
> **Rutuja:** “Download app code.”
> **Sanika:** “Extract all → C drive → Path copy → Environment variable edit.”

Piece by piece, they configured **Apache Maven 3.9.11**.
It wasn’t just about setting paths — it was learning the invisible backbone of software build systems.
Rutuja’s excitement when `mvn --version` worked was pure joy.
For her, that wasn’t a command — it was a **badge of progress**.


### 🧰 Scene 5: “Create Folder, Create Class”

They created folders manually — no wizards, no IDE magic —
understood how `src` and `bin` come into play,
and wrote a small Java class again —
this time knowing *why* each file existed.

> **Sanika:** “Looping statements, switch case, data type, print, user input…”
> **Rutuja:** “OK, OK… divide topics properly.”

It was no longer chaos. It was **structured self-learning** in action.


### 🚀 Scene 6: “Maven Installed — What’s Next?”

When the toolchain was ready, Sanika softly said:

> “Now we can move toward automation testing.”

That one line showed transformation —
from learners memorizing syntax to **developers thinking in systems.**
They were beginning to see the larger picture —
how Java, VS Code, and Maven fit into a professional workflow.


### 🌙 Scene 7: Wrapping Up

> **Sanika:** “Thank you, guys.”
> **Rutuja:** “Good night, sir.”

The session ended with laughter, gratitude, and screens fading to black.
But their minds were lit up — filled with the satisfaction of **building something that finally worked**.
The installation hurdles, PATH errors, and small triumphs had shaped their developer mindset.


### 💬 Mentor Reflection

As I watched them navigate each dialog box,
I realized — mentoring isn’t about teaching Java syntax.
It’s about **building self-reliance and confidence** line by line.

When they say *“Select last dual option”* or *“HelloWorld not recognized”*,
they aren’t just solving technical errors —
they’re **learning to think like engineers**.

That’s the real success — when students stop asking “Why me?”
and start saying “Let’s try again.”
