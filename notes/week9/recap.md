# 🌱 FullStack Developer Journey

**“OK team, let’s get started with another exciting week.”**
Take a look around—you already have your GitHub repo where all of our weekend learning sits. We gave this journey a title:

👉 *“From Testing to Building: Becoming a Full-Stack Developer.”*

And this is exactly what we’re doing: taking you step by step from the foundations into building, testing, and finally scaling real applications.


## 🏗️ What we’ve done so far

* **Foundation & Setup** → We began with programming basics.
* **Backend & REST APIs** → Learned controllers, routing, services, CRUD operations.
* **Testing** → Postman, unit tests.
* **Database** → Wrote SQL queries, joins, and integrated them with APIs (without heavy ORM—just relational thinking).
* **Front–Back Integration** → AJAX, connecting backend to frontend.

By **week 10**, most of you were comfortable with Git, with .NET Core, and with building working APIs.

## 🚀 The Next Phase

Now, here’s the important shift:
Since you already learned **object-oriented programming in C#**, jumping into **Java** is no longer a mountain—it’s just a hill.

If C# took you \~30 hours, **Java can be learned in 5–10 hours**. Why? Because the core OOP concepts are the same—the syntax just changes.

So our plan is:

1. Set up Java development environment (VS Code / Eclipse).
2. Quickly revise OOP in Java.
3. Build repositories, services, controllers (the same patterns you used in .NET).
4. Write simple Spring Boot APIs.
5. Connect to a database via **JDBC** (like we did with ADO.NET).

Once that’s solid:

* Learn **Spring Boot REST APIs**.
* Write unit tests for every controller, service, and repository—both in Java and C#.

## 🧪 Testing & Automation

We won’t stop at coding.
We’ll expand into:

* **Automation testing** (Selenium, TestNG).
* **Test automation frameworks**.

This way, you’re not just building, but also validating software like a professional.

## 📌 Capstone Project

Remember our **TFL Assessment Project**? That’s where all this learning converges.

It’s an **AI-enabled online assessment system**:

* Trainers (mentors) add questions, options, and answers.
* An **AI engine** (our “co-mentor”) generates additional questions based on complexity levels and topics.
* Students attempt tests, and the system evaluates not only marks but also *confidence and comfort level*.

### Tech breakdown:

* **Database** → MySQL (18 tables: users, roles, subjects, question bank, results, etc.).
* **Backend** → .NET Web API + Spring Boot Microservices.
* **AI Integration** → OpenAI APIs to generate and feed new questions into the system.
* **Frontend** → Web portal for candidates and mentors.



## 🏢 Architecture Thinking

We discussed:

* **Monolith vs Microservices** → splitting one big app into smaller, independent services.
* **Repository & Service patterns** → separation of concerns.
* **Dependency Injection** → in .NET and Java (constructor, method, property injection).
* **Database Best Practices** → SQL queries, stored procedures, preventing SQL Injection (using Dapper in .NET / PreparedStatements in Java).


## 🌟 The Bigger Picture

By practicing this journey:

* You’ll be able to position yourself as a **full-stack developer**.
* You’ll be confident in **.NET + Java + SQL + Testing + Microservices**.
* And most importantly, you’ll have built a **real-world capstone project** (TFL Assessment System) that demonstrates all these skills.


**Mentor’s final note:**
*"Don’t just learn frameworks. Learn the logic, the architecture, the principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS). Tools will change, but patterns and clean thinking stay with you."*
